# Final challenge for the course of Principles of Machine Learning

In 1998, the Adventure Works Cycles company collected a large volume of data about their existing customers, including demographic features and information about purchases they have made. The company is particularly interested in analyzing customer data to determine any apparent relationships between demographic features known about the customers and the likelihood of a customer purchasing a bike. Additionally, the analysis should endeavor to determine whether a customer's average monthly spend with the company can be predicted from known customer characteristics.

- Explore the data and gain some insights into Adventure Works customer characteristics and purchasing behavior.
- Build a logistic regression model to predict if a customer is a bike buyer.
- Build a linear regression model to predict a customer's average monthly spent with the company.
